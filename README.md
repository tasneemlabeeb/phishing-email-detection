# 🔍 Phishing Email Detection using BERT

An intelligent phishing email detection system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to classify emails as legitimate or phishing with **95.6% accuracy**.

## 📊 Project Overview

With the rapid rise of AI-generated content, phishing emails have become more sophisticated and harder to detect through traditional methods. This project leverages a fine-tuned BERT model to analyze email content and distinguish between phishing and legitimate messages.

## 🎯 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 95.6%
- **Precision**: 99.2%
- **Recall**: 92.4%
- **F1 Score**: 95.7%

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Model**: BERT (bert-base-uncased)
- **Framework**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Libraries**: 
  - `transformers` - BERT model and tokenization
  - `torch` - Deep learning framework
  - `scikit-learn` - Evaluation metrics
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `seaborn`, `matplotlib` - Visualization
  - `nltk` - Text processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- 2GB+ RAM recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phishing-email-detection.git
cd phishing-email-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset (automatic in notebook):
```bash
# Dataset will be automatically downloaded from Kaggle via kagglehub
```

### Usage

#### Option 1: Run the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook "Phishing detection (1).ipynb"
```

#### Option 2: Use the Interactive Predictor
Run the last cell in the notebook to classify any email:
```python
# The cell will prompt you to paste an email
# Press Enter on an empty line to get prediction
```

## 📖 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset)
- **Total Samples**: 82,486 emails
- **Training Sample**: 2,500 emails (balanced)
- **Split**: 70% train, 10% validation, 20% test

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: BERT (bert-base-uncased)
- **Fine-tuning**: 2 epochs
- **Batch Size**: 8 (with gradient accumulation)
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-5
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Device**: CPU/GPU/MPS (auto-detection)

## 🔬 Methodology

### Preprocessing
- **Lowercasing only** - Preserves phishing indicators like:
  - URLs (suspicious links)
  - Special characters (@, $, !)
  - Numbers (fake IDs, OTPs)
  - HTML tags
  - Deliberate misspellings

### Training Pipeline
1. Data loading and sampling
2. Text preprocessing (lowercase)
3. Tokenization (BERT tokenizer)
4. Model fine-tuning (2 epochs)
5. Evaluation on test set
6. Model saving (SafeTensors format)

## 💡 Example Usage

### Phishing Email Example
```
URGENT: Your account has been compromised!
Click here immediately to verify your identity: http://suspicious-link.com
If you don't act within 24 hours, your account will be suspended.

Result: 🚨 Phishing (87.7% confidence)
```

### Legitimate Email Example
```
Hi team, our weekly meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM.
Please review the attached agenda beforehand.
Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Result: ✅ Legitimate (91.2% confidence)
```
